### **Resume:**
> Nac√≠ en Cuernavaca, Morelos M√©xico.

> En mi √∫ltimo trabajo me desarroll√© como sub-gerente en el √°rea administrativa. (Tambi√©n desarroll√°ndome a nivel educativo.) Con lo cual usamos herramientas tecnol√≥gicas para comenzar a automatizar la empresa. Desde la creaci√≥n de su p√°gina web, redes sociales, asistentes de chat y bases de datos. Hasta en la implementaci√≥n en el √°rea contable y administrativa para toma de decisiones basadas en datos. Ej. ¬øD√≥nde convendr√≠a mandar agentes de ventas presencialmente y cu√°les clientes se pueden abordar de manera remota? Claro que para todo esto fuera posible utilizamos distintas herramientas y hubo muchos procesos. 

> Por ello muestro mis habilidades en forma de gr√°fica. 

> Adem√°s de tener algunos proyectos anteriores que me brindaron experiencia con Python, HTML, CSS, Linux, Microsoft en general, Adobe, etc. 
M√°s informaci√≥n en mi historia.

>Realice algunas certificaciones como Analista de datos con Google en Coursera y otras como Data Scientist & AI con Platzi. Actualmente, quiero continuar en este camino y convertirme en Machine Learning Engineer. 
> Concluyo en poder tener las habilidades que se requieren tanto matem√°ticas, l√≥gicas, tecnol√≥gicas y blandas para ser un Cient√≠fico de datos, pero nunca se para de aprender. Por ello inicio esta nueva etapa adentr√°ndome m√°s al mundo tecnol√≥gico e ir aprendiendo.

  <blockquote>
  <!-- My history -->
I was born in Cuernavaca, Mexico.

It all starts around the age of 13 with an interest in graphic design and programming, art, and ecology. At that age, he was taking simple jobs, which made me see a demand for design and advertising.
When i was 15 years old, I start with freelance design jobs and some projects.

When i was  16 to 19 years, I started working in an advertising printer where I was allowed to develop further as a designer and administrative assistant, along with that I was studying Marketing and Advertising at the university. By not presenting myself with a challenge beyond just seeing what I had already been working on, I decided to change my career, now to International Relations and Economics, which I find very pleasant I studied for about a year and a half, but that resulted in giving me more desire to start and have his own business, so he dropped out at 20 and ended up working in some places and projects, apart from also learning about Sustainable Sciences in workshops and courses.

when i was 21 years, I start a more formal business of ecological furniture made with tires and recycled wood. During that period my first daughter was born. He also had to have an extra job, he left that venture due to a lack of resources and time. And my father introduces me to the sale of art;
With what I earned I put together to invest in telecommunications networking, and the growth of the team turned out well and I managed to earn some money very quickly.

Approximately 22 years, I began to invest in creating a small restaurant-bar called "La Barra Azteca", a concept of burritos with pre-Hispanic ingredients and mezcal, I sold the idea and soon I met a person and we partnered to create some pizzerias, the idea came to life. called "Pizzharina" a flour tortilla pizza instead of dough, as they are traditional. We continued to open up 3 stores, but the one who was my partner, ended up defrauding people and me, but I ended up being the one who paid the piper because this person disappeared and my name was at stake.
Because I'm telling you this... Because it's part of my experience,  and it's part of my ethics. Besides, now I find it funny.

Due to what happened, I incur several debts, but I continue to work three jobs at the same time because a second baby was on the way.
So in the mornings she was a carpenter's helper since there were no jobs available, after that she sold some novelty products, in the evenings she made designs and on the weekends she studied 3D design and video editing. It didn't take long for the owner of the carpentry to promote me to carry out 3D modeling of furniture designs, and kitchens, and to be his accounting assistant due to my previous experience. A few months passed and that was exactly what made me decide to start my advertising agency, which is where "Tree House, Publish and Desing" was born. But its first creation did not last very long, because they made me an offer to work with a company dedicated to the corporate image of schools, whose company had been in the market for more than 50 years. called "Impex". I work from the production area, sales, and design to the accounting area and then administrative. Where I was able to further develop my team management, but above all, I was able to lead the company through a technological renovation, from the creation of its website, design, advertising campaigns, and its introduction to networks, Google Analytics, etc. In the period from 2018 to 2020, due to the pandemic and its clients primarily belonging to the education sector, their sales decreased and later they stopped working.

# We need to take advantage of the opportunities:
>Within the period from 2018 to 2020, I also spent my free time learning more about social media marketing, data analysis, and video marketing, which I was applying in my work at [Impemex](https://www.impemex.com/ ) how I commented before when the pandemic occurs, and I cannot continue working in that company. But precisely the knowledge that I had acquired allowed me to continue with my Tree House project, where the market demand increased from wanting to move into the digital age. I put together a team where we carried out everything from the design of the web page, and campaigns on social networks, with Google Ads, to position some businesses, like this until mid-2021, the problem came when I did not know how to automate all those processes.

# Python is coming:
>My search for how to automate social media processes, and to help make good business decisions, assistance and organization, customer service bots, and many other related parties, led to my interest in using artificial intelligence, where I found Python and **Machine learning**, and so I began to study self-taught, also doing certifications on the web and data analysis with [Google](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash -course/ml-intro), for my good luck [Impemex](https://www.impemex.com/) started activities again, and they invited me to work again, which allowed me to study in this year 2022. [Platzi](https://platzi.com/home) the career of Data Scientist & AI.

# In Present:
> After the "Impemex" company presented some problems due to the pandemic, the owners decided to sell the company, and thus a new beginning is beginning for me. Where I am looking to develop myself as a Data Scientist and continue to become a Machine learning engineer.
Currently, I will be uploading my progress on GitHub.
And I'm looking to continue writing more stories...
